{% docs vitaldata_desc %}

This table contains the daily vital data of users of the Datenspende App, imported from Thryve and updated daily. The triplet of user, vital type, and date is unique (there can only be one step count for user 12345 on the 26th of June 2022). The table is updated nightly with the data received on the previous day. Sometimes, this also includes data that is older than one day, e.g. when someone connects their wearable to the Internet for the first time in a couple of days.
