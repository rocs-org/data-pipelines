Welcome to ROCS dbt setup! Here we keep all dbt models for all projects :)

### User guide

- each project has its own folder in /models
- to add a model it is enough to create a new .sql file
- after testing it locally works (you might need to add test data) you can open a PR
- You can ask Jakob and David for help!
